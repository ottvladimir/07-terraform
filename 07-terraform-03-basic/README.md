# Домашнее задание к занятию "7.3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

Если в рамках предыдущего задания у вас уже есть аккаунт AWS, то давайте продолжим знакомство со взаимодействием
терраформа и aws. 

1. Создайте s3 бакет, iam роль и пользователя от которого будет работать терраформ. Можно создать отдельного пользователя,
а можно использовать созданного в рамках предыдущего задания, просто добавьте ему необходимы права, как описано 
[здесь](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html).
1. Зарегистрируйте бэкэнд в терраформ проекте как описано по ссылке выше. 


## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 
1. Для феншую: - сначала делаю `terraform init && terraform apply` c переименованным файлом backend и закоментирванным aws_instance в main.tf так создается бакет который можно убить через terraform destroy. Потом делаю terraform init -reconfigure и получаю terraform.tfstate в бакете.

1. Создаю два воркспейса `terraform workspace new stage && terraform workspace new prod`.

 Вывод workspace list:
```bash
$ terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage
```
 Вывод terraform plan для prod
 
 ```bash
 $ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the
following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
